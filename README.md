# TensorFlowGame

This is a prototype of a game made with Machine Learning to track hands. Use your camera as input to test it.
The model for the Artificial Neural Network is from the MediaPipe group (https://google.github.io/mediapipe/), as well as the basic library for running Tensor Flow.

Feel free to fork this project and make your own versions. Be kind to refer me when you do it.

*The version 1.0.0 was made in a couple of days and definetely needs a clean up.*

## Working with new songs

To work with new songs and new levels for this game, edit the songData.json file, adding on the same structure. Right now, all resources are loaded when the page loads, so you may consider a better approach for multiple files.
